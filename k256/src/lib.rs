//! Pure Rust implementation of the [secp256k1] (K-256) elliptic curve,
//! including support for the
//! [Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)][ECDSA],
//! [Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)][ECDH], and general purpose
//! elliptic curve/field arithmetic which can be used to implement
//! protocols based on group operations.
//!
//! ## About secp256k1 (K-256)
//!
//! secp256k1 is a Koblitz curve commonly used in cryptocurrency applications.
//! The "K-256" name follows NIST notation where P = prime fields,
//! B = binary fields, and K = Koblitz curves (defined over F₂).
//!
//! The curve is specified as `secp256k1` by Certicom's SECG in
//! "SEC 2: Recommended Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters":
//!
//! <https://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf>
//!
//! ## ⚠️ Security Warning
//!
//! The elliptic curve arithmetic contained in this crate has never been
//! independently audited!
//!
//! This crate has been designed with the goal of ensuring that secret-dependent
//! operations are performed in constant time (using the `subtle` crate and
//! constant-time formulas). However, it has not been thoroughly assessed to ensure
//! that generated assembly is constant time on common CPU architectures.
//!
//! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
//!
//! ## Minimum Supported Rust Version
//!
//! Rust **1.44** or higher.
//!
//! Minimum supported Rust version can be changed in the future, but it will be
//! done with a minor version bump.
